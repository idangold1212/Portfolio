# Exploratory Data Analysis

**Brief:**

I'm an analyst at Crankshaft List,and I need to study data collected over the last few years and determine which factors influence the price of a vehicle.

**Data Description:**

* price
* model_year
* model
* condition
* cylinders
* fuel — gas, diesel, etc.
* odometer — the vehicle's mileage when the ad was published
* transmission
* paint_color
* is_4wd — whether the vehicle has 4-wheel drive (Boolean type)
* date_posted — the date the ad was published
* days_listed — from publication to removal

**Goal:**

* Calculate and add to the table :
  * The vehicle's age (in years) when the ad was placed
  The vehicle's average mileage per year
  * In the condition column, replace string values with a numeric scale
* Carry out exploratory data analysis
